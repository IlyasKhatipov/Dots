## Short Description

Dots is a minimalist arcade game where the player controls a ball. The goal is to score as many points as possible while avoiding red balls and the arena boundaries.

---

## Gameplay

- The player controls a single ball.
- Press `Space` to jump.
- Use `A` and `D` (or `←` / `→`) to move left and right.
- Red and green balls spawn on the arena:
  - Hitting a **red ball** ends the game.
  - Hitting a **green ball** gives points.
- The game also ends if the ball collides with the arena boundaries.

---

## Controls

- `Space` — Jump
- `A` / `←` — Move left
- `D` / `→` — Move right

---

## Scoring

- Each collision with a green ball gives **+1** point (default).
- The game ends when:
  - The player hits a red ball, or
  - The player collides with the arena boundaries.
